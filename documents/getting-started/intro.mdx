# Getting started

Let's discover **Tzap in less than 5 minutes**. 

Tzap enables semantic search of code and is a great rubberducky that helps you navigate complex tasks in your code. 

### Choose installation method
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="bash" default>

To install on linux or mac by running this script from the terminal.
```bash
curl -L https://tzap.io/sh | bash
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm/npx">

**Using NodeJS package managers npm/npx**

This method requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to be installed. 

```bash
sudo npm install -g tzap
```

:::tip Run Tzap directly using NPX
It's possible to run Tzap without installation by prepending npx before the tzap command. NodeJS is still a requirement for this method. 
```bash
npx tzap --help
```
:::
#### Troubleshooting: 
Using npm/npx requires that the environment variable PATH is set correctly.

  </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">
To install the Tzap CLI without a package manager:

- Download the latest binary file from [GitHub](https://github.com/tzapio/tzap/releases/latest).

- Find the file and architecture you need.
  - Macs with M1 and M2 chips use the arm64 architecture.
  - Macs without Apple Silicon use the amd64 architecture.

- Either run ./tzap directly or install it to a location in your $PATH like /usr/local/bin.
```bash
sudo mv tzap-darwin-[replace with arm64 or amd64] /usr/local/bin/tzap
```

- Download the latest binary file from [GitHub](https://github.com/tzapio/tzap/releases/latest).

- Find the file and architecture you need.

- Either run ./tzap directly or install it to for instance /usr/local/bin or another location in your $PATH.
```bash
sudo mv tzap-linux-[replace with amd64 or arm64] /usr/local/bin/tzap
```

## Simple setup

To get started with Tzap start with **navigating to your code project** in a terminal.

```bash
~/code $ cd yourproject
```

## Your first tzap prompt

Tzap prompt looks at your code and then answers your code generation related questions. 

The more detail you add, the more focused Tzaps answer will be. 

Imagine that you have a file called `src/models/user.tsx` and want to add an email property to the model. 

To do this use the following:
```text
~/code/yourproject $ tzap prompt "Add email to the user model"
Search result:
        src/model/user.tsx:1
        src/controller/user.tsx:10
        src/service/userService.tsx:43

--- Completion
// highlight-start
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}
// highlight-end 
---
```
:::tip Write to file
There are `tzap` commands such as [`refactor`](basics/refactor), [`editdir`](basics/editdir) that write directly to file. For prompt specifically, we are currently developing prompt to be able to write directly to file.

## Search

Tzap can also be used to search for code.

```bash
~/code/yourproject $ tzap search "user model"

Search result:
        src/model/user.tsx:1
        src/controller/user.tsx:10
        src/service/userService.tsx:43
```

You can then in most editors hover and click these links like any other error message in the IDE

## Configure files to index

To configure Tzap for your project start with **navigating to your code project** in a terminal.

```bash
~/code $ cd yourproject
```


Tzap is configured to work without any configuration. Tzap it will index most common languages. 

```bash
~/code/yourproject $ tzap init
```
This will create `.tzapinclude` and `.tzapignore` files. You can then use these files to include or exclude files from being indexed. `.tzapignore` will filter out files even if they are included in `.tzapinclude`.

You can read more about how Tzap file indexing works here.

## Troubleshooting

### What files does Tzap look at?
Without any configuration Tzap looks at common programming languages. (Add link to languages)

You can run `tzap init` which will create a .tzapinclude and .tzapignore files. `.tzapignore` and `.gitignore` are first used to remove files from being indexed
