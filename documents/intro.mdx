# Tutorial Introduction

Let's discover **Tzap in less than 5 minutes**. 

Tzap enables semantic search of code and can also be a rubberducky for how to navigate complex tasks in your code. 

## Getting Started

Get started by **navigating to your code project** in a terminal.

```bash
~/code $ cd yourproject
```

### Choose installation method
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="bash" default>

To install on linux or mac by running this script from the terminal.
```bash
curl -L https://tzap.io/sh | bash
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm/npx">

This method requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to be installed. 

### Method 1: Install global pcakage:
```bash
sudo npm install -g tzap
```

### Method 2: Run directly
It's possible to run Tzap without installation by prepending npx before the tzap command. NodeJS is still a requirement for this method. 
```bash
npx tzap --help
```

#### Troubleshooting: 
Using npm/npx requires that the environment variable PATH is set correctly. Read more...

To install the Tzap CLI without a package manager:

- Download the latest linux tar.gz file from [GitHub](https://github.com/tzapio/tzap/releases/latest).

- Find the file and architecture you need.

- (Optional) Rename the tzap file.

- Either run ./tzap directly or install it to a location in your $PATH.

## Your first tzap prompt

Tzap prompt looks at your code and then answers your code generation related questions. The more detail you add, the more focused Tzaps answer will be. 

Imagine that you have a file called `src/models/user.tsx` and want to add an email property to the model. To do this 

```bash
tzap prompt "Add email to the user model"
```

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
